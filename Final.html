				<p>I was placed in charge of the 3D printing criteria of the project and pondered about what I can build in relation to our design. Finally, I decided to work on a cover for the arduino board. Since the rest of the design is well catered to. I started designing a case on sketchup with added rebate joints but however, I realised it does not protect the arduino entirely and it does not have enclosures on the top. Thankfully Steven my lecturer told me that I can just get a arduino designed cover from thingiverse since its more convenient and can perfectly fit the arduino</p2> 
				<p2>Jeanine designed and laser cutted the wood by using Inkscape. She used Fusion360 to design the tray with joints and then converted it into a DXF file later on</p2>
				<p2>Rifky and Airiez worked on the technology side of the project, they used 2 open source libraries which is the DHT11 librayr as well as the adafruit i2c LCD library. The first library was used to program the thermistor to read temperature and humidity while the second library was used to program the LCD monitor to display information. When the 2 libraries are combined together, temperature readings in real time will be displayed on the LCD screen</p2>
