					<h2>Fablab Safety Precautions</h2>
				<p>Before actually getting into the process of using the facilities, we must adhere to the fablab safety rules.
				<p>Since I’m a male, I need to make sure my hair is trimmed, in a short sleeved t-shirt, no wearing of loose items, Long pants and covered shoes</p>
					<h3>Other things we need to take note of...</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>We must maintain a clean and neat work area, by keeping all Guards and covers in place</li>
						<li>We are not allowed to operate the machines without the presence or permission of an instructor</li>
						<li>Do not start the machine until the work-piece and work-holding devices aren’t securely fastened properly</li>
						<li>Remember where the emergency buttons are for each individual equipment</li>
						<li>Not to lean on and moving parts while machine is in operation</li>
						<li>Use hand gloves when removing any heated or hot objects</li>
						<li>Remove chips or broken pieces after confirming that the machine has stop operating</li>
						<li>Make sure to be focused when using the machines and no playing around is allowed, or the risk of making contact with the dangerous components of the machine is higher</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We also need to know where the first aids are being placed so that in an event where an accident transpires, we are able to act fast</p>
					<p>Lastly in case of a fire hazard, we are to remain calm and proceed to the nearest exit. Hence, we need to be familiar with the evacuation route and designated assembly area</p>
