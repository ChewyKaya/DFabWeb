					<h2>Introduction To Computer Aided Design</h2>
				<p>We learnt a few computer aided design programmes, such as Fusion360, TinkerCad and Sketchup to aid the process of our design. 
				We also learnt photoshop, to crop, resize and adjust our images to input it into our website.</p>
				<h3>Photoshop</h3>
				<p>In photoshop, changing the image size and maintaining the resolution is easy and important. We need to adjust the photo into a suitable size of 
				around 500 pixels by going to image and image size. </p>

				<p>However, there are other better alternatives like just editing the width and height of the picture through the code.</p>
				<p class="photo"> <img src="CAD 4.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
				<p> Or simply using external programmes such as Faststone image viewer, which is more convenient because its simple to use and the ratios for cropping
					the photos are provided, or you can do it freehand </p>

				<h3>TinkerCAD</h3>
				<p>In TinkerCAD, we used the Arduino boards to stimulate the different types of circuits and components.  From there, we are able to easily connect
				the wires between the breadboard, arduino board and other components. Starting the stimulation and testing the circuit on TinkerCAD, will also
				reveal the code behind the circuit.</p>
				<p>In this scenario, the motor will be powered by the power supply and trigger the output of spinning it</p>

				<p>Same goes for the lightbulb which it will light up when the output is triggered
				<p class="photo"> <img src="CAD 5.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
				<p>All in all, its way more clear and efficient using TinkerCAD instead of physically because the wires may be tangled making it incovenient to configure
				the circuit
				<h3>Fusion360</h3>
				<p>Fusion360 is a really good programme used for designing products and what's distinguishes it from other programmes or softwares is that there is a
				timeline feature which allows the user to fall back to if they mess up halfway during their design process.</p>
				<p class="photo"> <img src="CAD 7.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>									   
				<p>I designed a keychain with my name on it in Fusion360 for the assignment and it was really cool since it was my first time designing a keychain using this
				software</p>
				<p class="photo"> <img src="CAD 9.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
				<p>Fusion360 also have side folders which allows us to manipulate the design easily without worrying about affecting the design if something goes wrong</p>
				<p class="photo"> <img src="CAD 8.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
				<p>After completing the keychain on Fusion360, the file will be imported to Ultimaker Cura 4.4 for 3D printing</p>
