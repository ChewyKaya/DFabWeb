					<h2>Introduction To 3D Printing</h2>	
				<p>3D printing is the process of making a physical model from a three dimensional digital one. The model is being made by adding layer over layer of a material 
				called, “raisin”. The purpose of 3D printing is to make a model in the most efficient way possible with minimal material used. And the best part of 3D printing
				is that the final product is sturdy and strong</p>

				<p>We were told to have a test on the design rules for the 3D printer to understand its limitations. My group did bridging, overhang, infill density and tolerance 
				for the test
				<p>These are the results of our test</p>
					<ul>
						<p>I worked on overhang, whereby the 3D printer will have to print a strip with various different angles, fortunately the printing was successful although at 85 
						degrees the bottom of the strip is not printed properly</p>

						<p>The tolerance test went really well, the model itself showed us the accuracy of the printing process and the optima clearance between the moving parts
						<p class="photo"> <img src="3D 10.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
							<li>The model doesn’t test tolerance of first layer since it’s more prone to being squashed against the bed and always has ample clearance on the first layer</li>
							<li>The model has cylinders with an overhang at 45%, this helps prevent the Centers from falling out</li>
							<li>Clearances are measured horizontally on the axis parallel to the printed layers, hence the overhang sections are lower but the horizontal clearance is all that 
							matters</li>
							<li>During the printing process, it’s possible to release 0.2mm instead of 0.15mm clearance</li>
						<p>The bridging test was difficult at first and it took my group 2 tries to get it right</p>
						<p class="photo"> <img src="3D 3.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
						<p class="photo"> <img src="3D 4.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
							<li>Our first attempt didn’t went well because we set the printing speed to 100 and aimed to finish printing it by 1 hour. However it failed, and the bridge barely 
							came out since the base wasn’t even printed properly</li>
							<li>Our second attempt we decided to change some settings including the speed and sure enough it printed out properly as seen</li>
						<p>Lastly the infill density test went well, the only thing we had to lookout for when printing it is that we have to abort the printing at 70% or else it will cover up 
						the infill, not revealing the inside</p>

					</ul>
					<p>For the individual assignment I decided to 3D print a sphere inside a triangle because it’s my favourite shape</p>
					<p class="photo"> <img src="3D 7.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
					<p class="photo"> <img src="3D 8.jpeg"height="250" width="500"/></p>
					<p>I wanted to design the triangle in a form of a pyramid, but decided against it since the printing may take quite awhile. Hence I concluded with a 2 sided triangle and
					rectangle form. The main difficulty for this project for me is positioning the sphere in the center of the triangle form. But eventually I managed to do it. Best part is that the 
					printing went smoothly</p>
