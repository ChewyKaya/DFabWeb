					<h2>Introduction To 3D Printing</h2>
				<p>We were introduced to the 3D printing machine called the Ultimaker Cura 4.4 and briefed on how it is supposed to be used along with the safety 
				measure or precautions learnt last week.
					
				<p>The material used to make the 3D printed models are called "raisin" and comes in many various colours
				especially gold and silver. We were taught how to input our design into Fusion360 and import it into Ultimaker Cura 4.4, to get it ready for printing.
					
				<p>We were given an SD card to import our files into the Ultimaker Cura 4.4 printing machine for printing.
					
				<p>We were taught how to slice the 3D model
				with various settings such as the
					
					<p>- The quality of the model</p>
					<p>- The shell of the model</p>
					<p>- The infill of the model</p>
					<p>- The material of the model</p>
					<p>- The speed of printing</p>
					<p>- The build plate adhesion</p>
					<p>- The general support required for the model</p>
					<p>- The cooling during the process of printing</p>
						
				<p>Upon slicing finish the model in Ultimaker Cura 4.4, we would then insert the SD card into the 3D printing machine and print the model. Most of 
				the time the printing will take up to 20-30 mintues depending on the settings. 
					
				<p>Upon completing the printing, we are to wait for the model to cool down and harden since its being placed on the heated printing plate over a long
				period of time. This will also ensure the model has the maximum strength through hardening. The model feels smooth and sturdy despite it being 
				made up of just raisin which does not seem to be a sturdy material to the eye.
