					<h2>Introduction To 3D Printing</h2>
				<p>We were introduced to the 3D printing machine called the Ultimaker Cura 4.4 and briefed on how it is supposed to be used along with the safety 
				measure or precautions learnt last week.
				<p>The material used t0 make the 3D printed models are called "raisin" and comes in many various colours
				especially gold and silver. We were taught how to input our design into Fusion360 and import it into Ultimaker Cura 4.4, to get it ready for printing.
				<p>We were given an SD card to import our files into the Ultimaker Cura 4.4 printing machine for printing.
				<p>We were taught how to slice the 3D model
				with various settings such as the
					<p> -The quality of the model
					- The shell of the model
					- The infill of the model
					- The material of the model
					- The speed of printing  
					- The build plate adhesion
					- The general support required for the model
					- The cooling during the process of printing
